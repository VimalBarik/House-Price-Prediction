# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and the number of bedrooms. 
Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, this model provides an estimate of house prices, offering insights 
into key factors that impact property values.

## Project Overview

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified significant features, visualized data distributions, and managed outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied scaling, encoding of categorical variables, and handling of missing values.
- **Modeling**: Trained multiple regression models including Linear Regression and Random Forest. 
- **Evaluation**: Used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see data exploration, feature engineering, and modeling steps.
2. Adjust model parameters in the notebook as needed.
3. Evaluate and compare model predictions on test data.
